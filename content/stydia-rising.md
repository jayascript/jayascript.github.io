# An Analysis of Twitter Reactions to the Teen Wolf S05E16 Premiere

## Skills: Data Mining, Database Creation, Database Management, Python, SQL, Twitter, Tableau

This is my first data analysis project, completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the University of Michigan's Python Specialization program on Coursera.

The project is a spin-off of a Super Bowl 50 Twitter analysis that I came across while doing some research. I was particularly excited at the way they correlated the winning moment in the game to the spike in tweets that occurred at the same time. I wanted to adapt their project to my own domain: a favorite TV show of mine that had recently experienced a similar elation-inducing moment.
