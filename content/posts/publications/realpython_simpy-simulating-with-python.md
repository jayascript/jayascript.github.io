Summary: In this step-by-step tutorial, you'll see how you can use the SimPy package to model real-world processes with a high potential for congestion. You'll create an algorithm to approximate a complex system, and then you'll design and run a simulation of that system in Python.

Podcasts are a great way to immerse yourself in an industry, especially when it comes to data science. The field moves extremely quickly, and it can be difficult to keep up with all the new developments happening each week!

Take advantage of those times in the day when your body is busy, but your mind is free: when you’re commuting to work, exercising at the gym, or cleaning up around the house. These are optimal times to engage your brain in learning something new and ensure you’re staying at the top of your field.

There are dozens of data science podcasts out there, covering everything from machine learning and artificial intelligence to big data analytics. We hope this will be a great resource for you to find useful, informative, and engaging shows.

Get ready to dive in!
