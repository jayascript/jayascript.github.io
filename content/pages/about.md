Hi there! My name is Jaya, and I write scripts. (See what I did there?)

My language of choice is English. I also know Python, and am learning Bash and JavaScript.

I'm currently a Master's student at Georgia Tech, where I study computer science and analytics. I also work as a freelance content writer.

I built this website using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), a static site generator written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

In my free time, I like to:

* immerse myself in stories (books, music, movies, TV; currently living in the 24th Century with TNG ❤️)
* pretend to be a housewife (cooking, cleaning, and organizing)
* frustrate my peers with my *pun*-chant for wordplay (I'm particularly [spond of foonerisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism) 🥄👀)
* eat sugar! (I'll do almost anything for a piece of chocolate 🍩)
* explore the nature of reality (consciousness, the origins of the universe, and life itself)

Don't be shy! Come say hi 👋
